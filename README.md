# MyRoots_Website
MyRoots is a project that was designed to create, share and remember our family histories in hte form of family trees.
For too long i have found that all the online platforms to make family trees have been locked behind paywalls and subscriptiongs.

That ends here. MyRoots is designed by a user for users with it being 100% free in mind and that it is to never have a price attached to it no matter what happens to the project.

As of now MyRoots is designed to be a web app that hopes to one day be available on all platforms (PC, iOS, Android, etc) as well as with a web version that is accessible as long as you have n internet connection.

MyRoots was founded back in 2022 but i have been putting the project off to the side now that i have free time i have decied that it is time i actually get around to figuring it out and making this. Not just so i can use it but so that everyone else in the world can use it. Its time we take better care of remembering our history and those who came before us.
